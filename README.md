# Monthly Challenges Daily on LeetCode

Welcome to the Monthly Challenges Daily repository! Here, we tackle data structures coding problems using Java on LeetCode. Whether you're a seasoned developer looking to sharpen your skills or a beginner eager to learn, you'll find something here for you.

## About

In this repository, we aim to solve a coding problem from LeetCode every day. By consistently practicing, we can improve our problem-solving abilities, deepen our understanding of data structures and algorithms, and become more proficient programmers.

## Structure

Each day, a new folder will be added containing:

- Java solution(s) for the problem of the day.
- A README.md file explaining the problem statement and our approach to solving it.
- Any additional resources or notes that might be helpful.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the solutions provided here. You can navigate through the folders to find problems you're interested in or challenges you'd like to tackle.

To run the Java solutions, ensure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can compile and execute the code using your preferred IDE or the command line.

## Contributing
