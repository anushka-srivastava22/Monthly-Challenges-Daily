Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

 class Solution {
    public int result = 0;
    public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        
        max(root);
        return result;
    }
    public int max(TreeNode root)
    {
        if(root == null)
        {
            return 0;
        }
        int l = max(root.left);
        int r = max(root.right);
        result = Math.max(result,l+r);
        return Math.max(l,r)+1;
    }
}
