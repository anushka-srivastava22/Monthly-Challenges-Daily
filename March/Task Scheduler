You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, n. Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: identical tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.

â€‹Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.

class Solution {
    public int leastInterval(char[] tasks, int n) {
        int[] freq = new int[26];
        for (char ch : tasks) {
            freq[ch - 'A']++;
        }
        
        // Max heap to store frequencies
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (freq[i] > 0) {
                pq.offer(freq[i]);
            }
        }

        int time = 0;
        // Process tasks until the heap is empty
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            int cycle = n + 1;
            List<Integer> store = new ArrayList<>();
            int taskCount = 0;
            // Execute tasks in each cycle
            while (cycle-- > 0 && !pq.isEmpty()) {
                int currentFreq = pq.poll();
                if (currentFreq > 1) {
                    store.add(currentFreq - 1);
                }
                taskCount++;
            }
            // Restore updated frequencies to the heap
            store.forEach(pq::offer);
            // Add time for the completed cycle
            time += (pq.isEmpty() ? taskCount : n + 1);
        }
